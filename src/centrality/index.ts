/**
 * Centrality computation
 *
 * Computes PageRank over the `calls` + `references` subgraph and
 * persists each node's score on the `nodes.centrality` column. Pure
 * compute — no I/O — so the caller owns reading edges, writing scores,
 * and deciding when to re-run.
 *
 * PageRank is the right shape for "what is structurally important?"
 * because it rewards being reached (weighted by the importance of who
 * reaches you), not just raw in-degree. A method called once from a
 * central interface ranks above a method called many times from a
 * leaf script.
 *
 * Edges of kind `contains` are deliberately excluded — they encode
 * lexical containment (file → class → method), which would dominate
 * the rank and hide actual reference flow.
 *
 * Side benefit observed in spike data: PageRank accidentally surfaces
 * resolver false-positives. Generic short names (`trim`, `run`) that
 * the resolver over-merges across files accumulate edges from many
 * sources and float to the top alongside genuine hubs. Useful as a
 * diagnostic; not a goal of this module.
