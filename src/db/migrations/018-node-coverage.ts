/**
 * Per-symbol code coverage from external CI artifacts (lcov, cobertura,
 * jacoco, coverage.py). One row per (node_id, source) so multiple
 * coverage providers can coexist without overwriting each other.
 *
 * The agent angle: once this table is populated, queries like
 *   "high-centrality functions with no coverage"
 *   "this PR adds branches with coverage_pct = 0"
 * become single SQL joins against `nodes` + `centrality` + this table.
 *
 * Coverage is per-symbol, not per-line: we summarise the line/branch
 * stats inside the symbol's source span. Line-level data lives in the
 * raw lcov file that fed the ingestion — agents that need it can
 * re-parse the source artifact.
