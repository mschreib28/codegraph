/**
 * Per-symbol code-health findings produced by the biomarker engine
 * (see `src/biomarkers/`). One row per (node_id, biomarker) so the
 * same symbol can carry multiple findings (e.g. a function flagged
 * both `large_method` and `complex_method`).
 *
 * Goal: expose static-analysis signals an AI agent can call before
 * making a change. The killer query an agent asks:
 *
 *   "I'm about to touch function X. Are there code-health issues
 *    I should know about?"
 *
 * answered by `SELECT * FROM code_health_findings WHERE node_id = ?`.
 *
 * Severity is a fixed lattice: 'info' | 'warning' | 'error'. The
 * aggregate Code Health score (1-10) is computed at query time from
 * this table — no separate score column, so adding a new biomarker
 * doesn't require a backfill.
