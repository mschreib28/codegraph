/**
 * Index-hook types.
 *
 * `IndexHook`s are derived-signal passes that run AFTER core
 * indexing/sync has finished — centrality computation, churn
 * mining, issue history, config-ref extraction, SQL call-site
 * scanning, co-change graph mining, etc. Today every such PR
 * mutates `CodeGraph` directly (private method + call site in
 * `indexAll` + call site in `sync`), forcing every-PR conflicts
 * on adjacent lines.
 *
 * After the registry refactor, each pass is its own file:
 *   - exports a `HOOK: IndexHook` constant
 *   - registers itself in `./registry.ts` (1 import line + 1 array entry)
 *   - implements `afterIndexAll` and/or `afterSync`
 *
 * `CodeGraph` stops growing per-pass methods. The hook runner
 * inside `CodeGraph` is a small generic loop that calls every
 * registered hook in sequence, swallowing errors so one broken
 * hook doesn't fail the whole index/sync.
